The Nope Programming Language
=============================

Nope is a subset of Python 3 that can be compiled to multiple targets.
At the moment, only Python and node.js are supported.
Any valid Nope program can be run directly as a Python 3 program.

Comments are used to provide static typing.
As well as detecting programming errors more quickly,
this allows translation to simpler code.
